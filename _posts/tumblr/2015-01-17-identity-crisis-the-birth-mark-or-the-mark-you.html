<p><span><strong>Identity crisis:</strong> The birth mark, or the mark you got as a kid, the one you had become used to over the years while growing up, when you thought you&rsquo;re scarred for life <span>(pun intended, or not ;] )Â </span>&ndash; begins to fade away, and one day you look, and it&rsquo;s barely there! And then it hits you, you&rsquo;re no longer you. The world [sadly] has changed you. True story.</span></p>
