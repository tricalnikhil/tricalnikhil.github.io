<p>Something I have been wanting to pen down (key down?), for a few days. Looking back - all of those decisions that you had to make, opportunities that you missed, the noes, rejections, failures, regrets &ndash; all that negativity that made it seem like the your world was falling apart. They have become so insignificant as of this very moment. Because all of that led you to where you are right now.</p>
<p>Even the big decisions, in fact largely the big decisions. Ephemeral!</p>
<p>What I regret though is the reactions to those events in life, the anger, the hatred, the sadness, the lull periods. What a waste of time. Some might argue that it made relationships stronger, but a lot of them left bitter feelings. I wish I could take all of that back.</p>
<p>The new life motto -<em> Be nice today, everything else falls into place eventually.</em></p>
