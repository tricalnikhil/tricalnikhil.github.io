<p>I remember while we were growing up, my dad used to have a couple of recorded audio cassettes and cds, that he used to listen to on his one day off from work, on an Akai CD player. Every Sunday, the same thing! He loved it, while we would complain. </p><p>As the years went by - the music grew on to us, growing up with some great music along the way, and the memory remains of those wonderful days.</p>
