<span style="font-weight: bold;">Info: </span>This is the highest peak in Shimoga                            District.  At the peak it is believed that 'Shankaracharya'                            did meditation. And to substantiate the same you will                            find a 'Sarvajna Peetha' at the top.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Departure</span> :  5:30 PM from college gate<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br />Duration</span> :  1 and 1/2  days<span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  ><br /><br />Three of us  (Choukkar, Sathya and me) left college campus at 5:30 PM. Took a bus  till Udupi. Reached Udupi at 6:15PM and waited for a direct bus to Kollur.  These are about half hour apart. The bus goes via Kundapura and then  to Kollur. We reached Kollur at 8:30 PM. and checked into the Temple  Guest House Lodge at the bus stand itself. It charges Rs.10 for bedding  to sleep in the common hall. We took a room for Rs 60.</span><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  ><br /><br />For dinner  we walked to the main city about 200m down the road to Archana hotel  and had awesome parathas followed by dosa. After this we walked back  to the room, chatted a while and decided to retire with plans of leaving  the city for the trek at 8:00 AM.</span><br /><br /><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >We got up the  next day a little too late and went behind schedule by an hour. We left  the city at some 9:00 AM. Also we did not get a bus to KariKatta gate,  where the trek to Kodachadri starts and decided to walk (about 12 Km  to gate) till we got a ride. After 3 Km we managed to stop a OMNI guy  who dropped us off at the gate.</span><br /><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >So at 10:00  AM we started our trek. The initial part seemed to be simple as it was  a down slope. But we were just dreading that on the way back, when we  are all tired it would be an up!<br /></span><div style="margin: 1ex;"><div><p align="justify"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgtzop7RdrI/AAAAAAAABdQ/Jgb_Y0IsNRc/s1600-h/DSC02840.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgtzop7RdrI/AAAAAAAABdQ/Jgb_Y0IsNRc/s320/DSC02840.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335485325836908210" border="0" /></a></p><p align="justify"><img src="file:///media/THEMEDIA/personal/trek/Kodachadri/Kodachadri%2520Trek/DSC02840.JPG" alt="" /><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >We saw a langur right at the beginning  of the trek, and a jackal a little later. We also observed a chameleon!  Soon we reached the much awaited ‘mallu’ place of which we had heard  alot about from Choukkar. We had refreshing lemon sharbat there and  rested a little only to think of when we would get back here on the  way back to have the same again!</span></p>  <p align="justify"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgt0GjytZdI/AAAAAAAABdY/-yg0txztQLQ/s1600-h/DSC02847.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgt0GjytZdI/AAAAAAAABdY/-yg0txztQLQ/s320/DSC02847.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335485839586452946" border="0" /></a><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >We left the  mallu place (which is little less than mid way to Kodachadri) and soon  entered dense jungle. Choukkar told us that this place was full of streams  and loads of leeches during the monsoon when he had come last. But luckily  as it was JAN we missed the leeches.  The trek soon got a little tough  with slippery tiny rocks on the path. We entered grassland terrain soon  and it had gotten really hot. But we continued only to take small 5  min breaks at times.</span></p><p align="justify"><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >Every time  Sathya and me looked at our destination, which looked way too far, we  said no way we our going up there. But Choukkar was sure that the peak  which looked far far away was where we were heading! After two hours  of trekking we reached our last pitstop – the PWD bungalow area. This  place had a nice aunty welcoming us tired souls and giving us buttermilk.  We had our lunch here itself as it was already 2.We rested a little  and headed back up to the peak(about a km or two away), leaving our  bags at the house and carrying only water and ‘chikki’ that we ad  carried from College. We reached the peak by some 3:00 PM where there  was a small Shankaracharya temple. We looked around and the view was  awesome. It seemed a little different as I was used to seeing mountains  in the morning, covered with fog and in the clouds. But still the view  here was breathtaking. They say if one is lucky, the Arabian Sea can  be seen at the distant horizon. We were not :-( Enjoyed our chikki  and a couple of calls to all those who ditched us by not coming and  we were ready to go.</span></p> <p align="justify"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgt1iOdQ42I/AAAAAAAABdg/IEJeYRCl3Oc/s1600-h/DSC02859.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgt1iOdQ42I/AAAAAAAABdg/IEJeYRCl3Oc/s320/DSC02859.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335487414407324514" border="0" /></a><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >We headed down  at some 3:30 PM to the house took our bags and left after having buttermilk  at 4:00PM.</span></p> <p align="justify"><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >We were keeping  good pace. But Choukkar had a leg injury so we slowed down. But  still our pace was decent. We reached the mallu place by 5:30 PM. It  was getting dark so we had some lemon sharbat and omelette,vada ; played  with the puppies there a while and left. The ‘mallu’ place being  referred to has a name btw – ‘Santosh’ hotel.</span></p> <p align="justify"><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgt2Db0XiQI/AAAAAAAABdo/-H-rqwvsngk/s1600-h/DSC02882.JPG"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/Sgt2Db0XiQI/AAAAAAAABdo/-H-rqwvsngk/s320/DSC02882.JPG" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5335487984929573122" border="0" /></a><span style=";font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:100%;"  >We saw small  groups of people walking in the opposite direction. A guy on the way  told us the Kara katta gate is 1.5 to 2 km away and we should hurry  up as it was getting darker. He also told us the next bus was at 7:00  So we did! But by 6:00 PM it had already gotten pretty dark so we hurried  up. Choukkar’s leg started hurting by now. Luckily he had remembered  to get a torch with him which was very useful, as by 6:30 PM it got  pitch dark in the forest. The last dreaded ascent seemed never ending  and we kept pushing each other to move on. Finally we reached the gate  only to find no bus coming. A jeep driver passing by told u the bus  is at 7:30 PM and he said it would be better for us to walk down back  one KM to a small town to the bus stop instead of waiting in the middle  of the jungle. So we walked another km to a checkpoint where the guard  told us that this is a Naxal area and that is why they were checking  all the vehicles passing by. We waited there till 8:00 PM and then we  got a lift in a jeep till Kollur. The driver was awesome and he drove  all the way down, 10 Km with the engine OFF! The jeep kept great momentum  all the while and we finally got off at the Kollur main city near the  Mookambika temple. The jeep driver told us there is no private bus back  to Udupi and the only bus out is a Kerala KSRTC at 9:00 PM. So we hurried  back to our room in the guest house, checked out and got on to the bus.  It was a direct bus to our college and we slept of very soon. After  all it had been a tiring day! We got off the bus at 11:30 PM at the  Girls Block gate and soon met our college friends coming back from there  own little party at Sharath... and soon we were back in the hustle and  bustle of college life... Of course only after a well deserved 12 hr  sleep!</span></p>   </div>  </div>
