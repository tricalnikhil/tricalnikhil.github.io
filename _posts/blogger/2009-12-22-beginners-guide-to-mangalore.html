Mangalore and nearby towns, are an awesome set of places. Being in Bangalore from childhood, I have hated how the city got attacked by the IT folks. People having the purchasing power, and now abusing it, and ruining my city. Too much to say/curse and bitch about, will probably write this in another post. <br />Sunday morning trips to Melagres, Alyosius and Dosa. Ideal ice cream. Cherry Square. Ice-berg, Chicken tikka at Saibeen, Finger colouring food at palkhi, Phulkas at hotel Anupama a lil away from PVS.<br />There are 3 main circles in Mangalore. Hampankatta which does not have much, Lalbagh which has a couple of malls, and Jyothi Circle. Get off the local buses at these stops and you will find a nice place to sit up and have a good meal. Apart from the places mentioned before, other nice restaurants, pubs and bars are -<br /><ul><li>Dolphin (Mangalore food)&nbsp;</li><li>Liquid Lounge (Nice pub, better than quite a few Bangalore ones, must try the Chicken Nuggets)</li><li> Froth On Top (Can spend a nice afternoon here, Chicken Stew + Appam/ Dosa, the place is also well known for its Sunday English Brunch)</li><li>Maharaja at Jyothi</li><li>Poptates (near Froth, Jyothi circle) for a nice grilled chicken.</li><li>Pereras (for stakes, never been there, place has got mixed reviews)</li><li>There is a CCD near Jyothi for the CCD addicts.</li><li>Bharath Mall has a Pizza hut (near Lalbagh)</li><li>Pabbas (must visit for ice cream, at Lalbagh)</li><li>Ideal ice cream joint at Hampankatta</li><li>Ice Berg at Jyothi</li><li>Diesel Cafe (Pub, good Italian food)</li><li>Hao Ming for Chinese (There is a very filling soup with rice crispies, and the chilly pork fry, nice place)</li><li>Miscief ( a rip off, but decent for a lunch)</li><li>many, many more....</li></ul>
