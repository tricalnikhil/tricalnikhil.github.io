<o:p></o:p>Date: <st1:date year="2007" day="27" month="3">27<sup>th</sup> March, 2007</st1:date>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Time of Departure: <st1:time minute="0" hour="7">7:00 AM</st1:time></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p></o:p>With a lot of difficulty and enthu of the CR going and knocking on everyone’s door all trical guys were up by 5:30 only to wake up to no water in the bathrooms. Bloody fourth block whores had their ‘magic tap’. I had remembered to store some water the previous night, smart ass that I am so I managed to freshen up. Others weren’t so lucky ;) But somehow the whole group managed to get itself ready by <st1:time minute="30" hour="6">6:30 AM</st1:time> and all of us gathered at the HOSTEL gate. All except VIPs Sounderajan and Shishir who came at 7:00 AM. Bloody wastages...Because of whom we got delayed by some 15-20 minutes. The KSRTC bus which was booked by us came on time at 6:30 AM sharp. The bus was booked from Mangalore KSRTC bus stand, Lalbagh, with minimum charge for 250 Km.</p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">So we set off on our long awaited trip, only to stop 50m ahead to pick up the girls who had been waiting at GB gate from <st1:time hour="6" minute="15">6:15 AM</st1:time> (or so they claim).<o:p><br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">NOW the real journey began. Group of 58 trical junta and 1 arbit guy from comps (my roomie). All of us were really eager for the long awaited trip as it was a break that we totally deserved. (<i>Dear Reader: Trical in NITK is HELL on earth. Its not so bad, but is getting there ;) </i>) </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">It wasn’t long before MAFIA fever emerged and with a little initiation from Paul and Utham, a group of 15 people started playing. Somewhere in the middle we stopped at Padubidri for an hour to pack the food for the trip (Poori, Aloo sabji and Pulough) from Hotel Sumangla. Some of us had our breakfast at the same place, while some others ate at VIJAYA restaurant on the main highway, at Padubidri itself. I took a few drags from Kamal’s ciggi and it felt good :). </p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">We then boarded the bus to continue the game, followed by a very non melodious round of never ending Antakshari (Yes, i too did sing, and it was not that bad). Next stop at Karkala. Then carried on only to get stabbed at Bajagoli where we realized that we had come 8 Km ahead towards Kudremukh and had to go back. This wasted a lot of our time. But everyone was enjoying the bus ride, so truly speaking no one cared at that moment. </p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">A few more wrong turns were made, reached Hebri, took a deviation and then managed to reach the Base camp at <st1:time minute="0" hour="12">noon</st1:time>. We all got off the bus. The food packets were distributed. Although the food was supposed to be kept for later, the hungry souls that we were..... The packets were ripped then and their and the food was raped till the last grain.<o:p><br /></o:p></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Now the real tough road ahead began. A 3 Km trek on a kuccha road and then a 2 Km or so tough trek, lead us to the Seetha falls. We were their at <st1:time minute="30" hour="13">1:30 PM</st1:time>. Soon everyone was in the water and having fun. The water fall is a tall but narrow fall. Everyone enjoyed for 2 hrs or so. The strong force of water when one went directly under the water was thrilling. Also, since it was summer the water was shallow so everyone could move about easily in the water.<o:p><br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">After about 2 hrs we all dried up, but got bambood by the whole water fall shifting because of strong winds and spraying us with water. After re-drying ourselves and filling our water bottles with natural water, we were geared up for the trek back to the bus. It took about 1 hr and everyone gathered at the stream near the bus , to play around a little more. Stupid water games- throwing stones in the water to splash on to the people crossing the stream. Guess our 'bachpana' is still not gone.<br /></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">All of us then got back into the bus, some of us tired but all of us really happy with the days events. Some slept, some sang, some (including me) played the card game- literature the rest of the way back to college.</p>          <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p></o:p>We all decided to get off little before college to dinner at Bitoo Dhaba. But the place was rather pissing off with we all waiting for the food, and getting the wrong stuff. But no one really cared that much.<br /><o:p></o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p></o:p>It was getting close to the girls block timings so we all hurried up, got back onto the bus, and returned to college. We reached college little before <st1:time hour="21" minute="30">9:30  PM</st1:time>.<o:p><br /></o:p></p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Soon everyone had dispersed and gone back to their rooms. Everyone slept early because their was a Power Systems Class at <st1:time hour="8" minute="0">8:00 AM</st1:time> the next morning :-( which i attended..thank you..<br /></p>    <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p><br />Looking forward to more of such awesome experiences........</p>  <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p> </o:p></p>
