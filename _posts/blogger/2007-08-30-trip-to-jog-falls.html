This is going to be a little breaky as I am taking inputs directly from my Phone notes.<br /><br />I guess Electrical class (yes, 04EE Mr. Rao) and water falls have a strange relationship. So once again we set out for a trip to Jog Falls - the highest water falls in India and supposedly the second highest in Asia (thats 253 meters or 829 ft :)<br />And the "<span style="font-weight: bold;">we</span>" this time was just about 15 of us. 14 to be exact.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Date</span>: 23rd August, 2007, thanks to Hebsur<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold;">Time</span>: Supposed to leave at 6:50 AM but again thanks to Hebsur we left college at 7:40 AM<br /><br />So we set out on the good ol' NH-17 Highway at 7:40 AM and reached Udupi by around 8:30 AM. Then we got lucky (not laid you pervs!) and got a bus to a place called Sagar. Bought some grub from the bus stand itself. I vaguely remember getting cheated and paying for overpriced biscuits. But no time for Consumer Rights naaras, gotta Jog it!<br /><br />We reached Sagar at around 1 in the afternoon and ate at this kutti place right opposite the bus stop. We booked two taxis for the remaining journey to Jog. Oh yes, we also bought some (hmmm...) booze here (innocent).<br /><br />The journey was real good as the roads were great, and the roads were surrounded by green (#00FF00 for the geeks)  all over. We stopped over at a farm to take the porki, Egyptian dance pic.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/SgkRR4mZr0I/AAAAAAAABcQ/quqj26hjFV0/s1600-h/n508114375_1335462_4276248.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/SgkRR4mZr0I/AAAAAAAABcQ/quqj26hjFV0/s320/n508114375_1335462_4276248.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334814232545963842" border="0" /></a>Jog has 2 points to visit. We reached point 1 at around 2:30. This is where parts of the water fall start off. We found a nice secluded spot and jumped right in.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/SgkTnrzIvaI/AAAAAAAABco/ZQufItYJSD8/s1600-h/n508114375_1335460_2731900.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/SgkTnrzIvaI/AAAAAAAABco/ZQufItYJSD8/s320/n508114375_1335460_2731900.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334816806090096034" border="0" /></a>Beer bottles were opened up at the top itself. Junta drank. All survived. We then set out to point 2 which is the base. 5 guys went down to the base point, Hebsur being the first to reach (duhhh). The rest of us jus sat around, ate lays (the wasted cityietes that we are) and chatted till the fog got in as they had just opened the gates.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br /><br /></span><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/SgkTuIt9SBI/AAAAAAAABcw/9grm4e-a9dA/s1600-h/n508114375_1335461_3698556.jpg"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fW35bCMAge4/SgkTuIt9SBI/AAAAAAAABcw/9grm4e-a9dA/s320/n508114375_1335461_3698556.jpg" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5334816916932216850" border="0" /></a>We had dinner at this  place called Mayura Hotel at the point. DO NOT attempt the THALI.<br />I would suggest having the bread-omelet, etc. as they are more (/only)  consumable.<br /><br />We then got a direct bus to Mangalore at around 8ish which starts off from the bus stop at point 2 itself. The bus journey was calm. Again vaguely remember a huge fight with some pic in someones' cam which was embarrassing for a certain someone and the certain someone and the owner of the camera had a big fight, over the certain someone trying to delete the pic. Or something of that sort. And i really don't remember the names. And the indirect references are just coincidental, not necessarily intentional.<br /><br />We reached college (NITK Suarthkal on NH-17, for those anonymous readers) at around 4 PM. Hung around the basket ball court till the GB gates opened. Went back to our rooms, sleeeeppyharddddd. And thats bout it from our Jog Trip.
