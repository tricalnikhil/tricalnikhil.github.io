# About me

I enjoy running, biking, yoga, skiing, hiking, backpacking and everything outdoors. I am currently trying to become a better 🏊🏼‍♂️ swimmer and a good 👨🏽‍🍳 cook.

I love to code. I enjoy working on tools. I'm a professional game developer.

I'm passionate about 🌿 Environmental issues, 🌈 LGBT issues.

Thank you for visiting my website.

Cheers 🍻
