# About me

I enjoy running, biking, yoga, skiing, hiking, backpacking and everything outdoors. I am currently trying to become a better swimmer and a good cook.

I love to code. I enjoy working on tools. I'm a professional game developer.

I'm passionate about environmental issues, LGBT issues.

Thank you for visiting my website. Cheers üçª
